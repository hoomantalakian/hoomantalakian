## ⁓ Welcome To My Page ⁓

Coding or Designing is not just about getting the job done. For me it's all about something bigger. it's about: Observing, Asking, Resolving, and again! The most enjoyable part of my job is finding the most efficient solution to a tiny problem. And what is the "problem" here? It's exactly what I can't resist figuring out! Quite honestly, I can call myself a "Bug Detective". This is more than a responsibility to me; it is also a concern that motivates me. It doesn't matter what language or tool it requires; I'll learn it!

Within the last 3 years, as a Web Developer, I have worked with a dozens of individuals and businesses in many different environments. As a local employee, as a freelancer, and of course, as a remote staff member. I should mention that I launched my own startup about 4 years ago. It is an online educational service for Music and Audio called "Khaneh-Ahangsazi". I'm very proud of it because this project has been very successful, and I have gained thousands of website visitors in a couple of months. As a result of large amounts of growth and progress, this website is currently on hold as we migrate it to the Next.js technology stack.
