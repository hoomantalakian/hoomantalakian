## ⁓ Welcome To My Page ⁓

Coding or Designing is not just about getting the job done. For me it's all about something bigger. It's about: Observing, Asking, Resolving, and again! The most enjoyable part of my job is finding the most efficient solution to a tiny problem. And what is the "problem" here? It's exactly what I can't resist figuring out! Quite honestly, I can call myself a "Bug Detective". This is more than a responsibility to me; it is also a concern that motivates me. It doesn't matter what language or tool it requires; I'll learn it!
